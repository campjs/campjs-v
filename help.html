    <h3>Getting to CampJS IV</h3>

    Free busses will get you to and from the CampJS venue. Busses will leave
    the airport around 2pm, then swing by <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/Varsity+Lakes/@-28.097158,153.399386,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b91032e5d3aa9e1:0x46b29dcc591f41d7">Varsity Lakes Railway Station</a> shortly

    <h3 style="clear: both;">Transport from CampJS IV</h3>
    <p>
    A single large bus will transport people to arrive at the airport to meet midday
    flights. Many people are driving down earlier and you may be able to catch
    a lift with them if you wish to depart more hastily, though we would
    appreciate any help straightening things out after the event.
    </p>

    <h3>Carpooling</h3>
    <p>
    You may find someone willing to carpool with you. Find people with
    available seats or advertise them on the flights/carpooling spreadsheet.
    </p>

    <h2>CampJS Start and End Times</h2>
    <p>
    The camp officially starts when the bus arrives on Friday, around 4:30pm, and
    ends Monday Morning around 9am. We are looking for volunteers to help set up on
    Friday. Volunteers may arrive any time after midday!
    </p>
    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    <p>
    The venue has dormitory bunk rooms. Dorms have access to toilet and
    shower facilities via a covered walkway. Mattresses are provided, but you
    will need to provide your own linen, blanket and pillow. You are welcome
    to bring tents if you wish to camp!
    </p>

    <h2>Diets & Menu</h2>

    Drinks, Breakfast, Morning Tea, Lunch, Afternoon Tea, Dinner and Supper

    We're bringing some Caffitaly coffee pod machines, and we'll be supplying

    <h2>Things To Bring</h2>

    <h4>Earplugs</h4>
    <p>
    I expect there to be noise late into night, and I can't guarantee people
    won't snore. If you want to sleep well, bring earplugs. I cannot stress
    this enough.
    </p>
    <p>
    I personally sleep with earplugs every night and it is bliss for me and
    convenient for others who can get on with their lives without worrying
    about disturbing me. If you don't bring earplugs, I don't want to hear
    you complaining about noise.
    </p>
    <h4>Warm Clothes</h4>
    <p>
    e.g. Jackets, Scarves, gloves, onesies. It can be pretty cold at night time.
    </p>
    <h4>Halloween Clothes</h4>
    <p>
      Friday October 31st is Halloween at CampJS! Wear your favourite costume
      or onesie and join the fun as we eat, drink and be scary!
    </p>
    <h4>Sleeping Bag + Pillow</h4>
    <p>
    It's going to be rather cool weather. I recommend bringing a sleeping
    bag. Maybe pack an extra blanket just in case. If you cannot bring such
    items please <a href="mailto:timo@campjs.com?Subject=Need%bedding"
      target="_top">let me know</a> and we will sort something out for you.
    </p>

    <h4>Bathroom</h4>
    <p>
    The usual – toothbrush, shampoo, soap, talisman of purification, deodorant, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Additional Drinks</h4>
    <p>
    Unlimited beer, red/white wine, a margarita machine, juice, coffee, tea
    and soft-drink is provided courtesy of CampJS. You're welcome to bring
    harder liquors if you so desire.
    </p>
    <h4>Snacks to Share</h4>
    <p>
    Please bring a little something and donate it to the snack pile.
    </p>
    <h4>Computer, Phone &amp; Associated Chargers</h4>
    <p>
    Power boards and cables will be available but it helps if people bring bring more. Please label them so we don't accidentally steal them.
    </p>
    <h4>Headphones</h4>
    <p>
    Music will be provided for the main hall, but if you
    want to listen to something different, please do so from the comfort of
    your own headphones.
    </p>
    <h4>Instruments</h4>
    <p>
    Bring 'em. Even noisy ones.
    </p>
    <h4>Medications</h4>
    <p>Let's stay healthy.</p>

    <h4>Warm Clothes &amp; Earplugs</h4>
    <p>Reminder: bring warm clothes and earplugs.</p>

    <h4>Tools for coping with no Internet</h4>
    <p>
    Plan to have zero internet. Don't plan to have even a little. Zero.
    </p>
