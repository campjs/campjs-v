      <h4>CampJS is for everyone who is interested in web technology. Beginners &amp; experts, all are welcome.</h4>
      <p>
        Networking with other developers is arguably the most valuable aspect of
        a conference, yet it's often a hurried and fleeting affair that happens
        in-between the schedule of a regular conference – but CampJS isn't a
        regular conference. This weekend-long retreat allows everyone enough
        time to learn new things, relax and most importantly: create real
        friendships and connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        CampJS creates a unique blend of expert-led, structured content
        and self-directed, unstructured learning. Some content is
        scheduled, but the main area is reserved for hacking. The final
        night is reserved for demos for people to show off what they have
        built or learned at the event.
      </p>
      <h3>When?</h3>
      <p>
        CampJS V will commence at 3pm Friday on the 22nd of May, and
        run through to 9am Monday the 25th of May. The Camp will be held at <a
        href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Lord+Somers+Camp+Parklands+Avenue+Somers&sll=-37.787844,145.025454&sspn=0.019637,0.046778&ie=UTF8&cid=-38391441,145152110,7610982389541332772&ll=-38.382642,145.160122&spn=0.023548,0.036478&z=14&iwloc=A&source=embed">Lord

      <p>
        The venue provides food, drink and comfortable accommodation for
        the duration of the event. You may camp on the grounds if that is
        your wish.
      </p>
      <h3>Transport</h3>
      <p>
      <strong>A bus will be provided to take attendees to and from the venue.</strong>
      It will travel from Tullamarine airport and back via Melbourne CBD. Interstate travellers should fly into Tullamarine airport around midday, busses will leave between 1 and 2pm. The return bus will get people back to the airport before midday.
      </p>
      <h3>Should you attend?</h3>
      <p>
      Yes you should.

      We’re going to dive into the mysteries of hardware programming with
      JavaScript. You’ll get all the parts and tools necessary to build your
      own kick-ass boat with a Spark Core at its connected heart.
      </p>
      <p>
      We’ll throw you in a team of two and your
      creativity and craftsmanship is key to come up with, build and program the best
      boat of the conference. This workshop will be delivered in multiple parts
      over the weekend and on the Sunday afternoon you’ll get to test your boat
      in a race against other competitors, with prizes for the winning team.
      </p>

        At the core of WebGL is GLSL, a domain-specific language that allows you
        to write code leveraging the power of your graphics card for super speedy
        rendering of countless triangles and/or pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/stackgl/glslify">glslify</a> adds a Node.js-like module system on top of the language, so you
        can create and consume community packages on npm with GLSL as easily
        as you can with JavaScript. <strong>This is an introduction to how glslify works, why you'd
        want to use it, and what's possible using the tool.</strong>

      <h3><a href="#nicolas-bevacqua">Nicolas Bevacqua</a></h3>
      <p>
        This workshop covers the past, present and future of web application
        performance when it comes to delivery optimization. We'll start by glancing
        over what you're already doing -- minifying your static assets, bundling them
        together, and using progressive enhancement techniques. Then we'll move on to
        what you should be doing -- optimizing TCP network delivery, inlining critical
        CSS, deferring font loading and CSS so that you don't block the rendering path,
        and of course deferring JavaScript. Afterwards we'll look at the future, and
        what HTTP 2.0 has in store for us, going full circle and letting us forego
        hacks of the past like bundling and minification.

      In this journey, we will explore the strange new worlds of ESNext's Iterators and Generators.<br />
      We will seek out new ways to loop; new iterations. <br />
      We will boldly code what no one has coded before! <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow along as we discover; How Iterators, and then Generators came to be; How they can be leveraged to solve practical problems, and; How they can be used in production today!

      <h3><a href="#jess-telford">Jess Telford</a></h3>
      <p>
        Scope Chains, Closures, Hoisting, and Garbage Collection all have one thing in common: They're often hand-waved away. How do closures actually work? When does Garbage Collection occur? What really IS the Scope Chain?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this talk, we will discover it's not black magic after all; No hand waving is required to explain these language features, in fact you've been using them all along without realising.

      <h3><a href="#ryan-pauley">Ryan Pauley</a></h3>
      <p>
        CORS enables web applications to share information from server to server.
        Without CORS, APIs, and much of the internet are far more frustrating to
        share with. Introduced to CORS in a Rails&lt;&gt;Node project, I had a
        head-smashing time trying to get our servers to play nice and share data.
        I wasn't content with stack overflow's cut &amp; paste fix and this
        presentation is the end result of my desire to come to a better idea of
        how to manage CORS challenges.

        <em>Your web apps are at risk!</em> Security is crucial but can be hard to get right.
        Luckily for web developers, the HTTP protocol comes with well-thought-out
        security specifications. Modern browsers implementing those security features
        are capable of doing much of the heavy lifting for us. It is our responsibility
        to put the browsers on guard. This talk explores which security headers are
        especially useful along with when and how to use them.

      <h3><a href="#adam-ullman">Adam Ullman</a></h3>
      <p>
        ORTC is a free open-source project that enables mobile and server
        endpoints to communicate with Real-Time Communications via native and
        simple JavaScript APIs. It builds upon the existing WebRTC capabilities
        of the browser and fills in some gaps to make interoperating with mobile
        devices and servers possible. This talk will answer some questions about
        what is missing in WebRTC, what does ORTC hope to achieve and why do you
        care. It will also dive into some open source ORTC implementations and
        give a demo.

      <p>
        Tracking data changes and presenting them to the user is a fundamental
        part of any web application. With Object.observe, JavaScript now offers
        us a fast, native way to track changes to standard objects without the
        need for custom model types or dirty state checking. As game-changing
        as this new functionality may be, we might just be seeing the beginning
        of the next great JavaScript rivalry: mutable versus immutable state.

      <h3><a href="#pomke-nohkan">Pomke Nohkan</a></h3>
      <p>
        Unlike others, for good or bad, the Javascript community is a headless
        monster. It is exactly the decentralised nature of the JS community
        which has allowed us to thrive far beyond other comparable
        technologies.
      </p>
      </p>
        So when it comes to steering the moral behaviour of the Javascript
        swarm, it takes a hive-mind rather than a top-down approach. So we need
        to be communicating about this on a regular basis.
      </p>
      </p>
        It is everyone's responsibility to make the Javascript community one
        which welcomes people from all backgrounds, and that unless we take
        this seriously and ALL contribute to what defines to collectively
        acceptable behaviour, then (even from a purely selfish POV) we rapidly
        diminish the quality of our environment (And of course do real harm to
        others).

      <h2><a name="nodeschool" href="#nodeschool">International NodeSchool Day</a></h2>
      <p>
      Inspired by Substack's <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-adventure">stream-adventure</a>,
      Rod Vagg unveiled <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode">learnyounode</a>
      and the <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper">workshopper framework</a> at CampJS II in August 2013.
      This began a chain reaction resulting in the formation of <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a>,
      an amazing global community spreading JavaScript skills worldwide.
      NodeSchool has grown to 26 workshops and inspired many hundreds
      of community events worldwide. You can read more about <a
        href="https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5">the
        creation of the NodeSchool community</a> in Mikael Roger's excellent post on the
        topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, on May 23rd the NodeSchool community is <a href="http://nodeschool.io/international-day/">organizing</a>
        a day of educational web events around the globe.
        This coincides with the second day of CampJS, so to celebrate we'll be
        mentoring NodeSchool sessions for <strong>the six workshops which were originally
        created for a CampJS event</strong>:

      <h3><blockquote>"Try and leave this world a little better than you found it"</blockquote></h3>
      <p>
        CampJS follows the <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule">scouts rule</a>.
        With this in mind, we strongly encourage &amp; support the creation of
        NodeSchool-esque workshops so presenter's efforts can benefit the
        global JavaScript community, continuing to educate far beyond the scope
        of a CampJS event. It would be great if this were a model more
        conferences would adopt! Big props to NodeConf US which also inspired
        the creation of a number of NodeSchool workshops last year.
